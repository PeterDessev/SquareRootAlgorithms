While reading is not required to understand any of the program, it still offers insights into the math behind each algorithm, and anaylsis on the results

## Building

To build the project use the make command in the project root directory

    make

The program has been tested working on Ubuntu and Windows 10, but not MacOS

## Algorithms Overview

The algorithms in this paper are split into two categories

- Estimate Production
- Estimate Iteration

Below are all of the algorithms represented in this program

### Estimate Production

- One as an estimate
- Input Over
- Floating Point Estimation
- Inverse Floating Point Estimation

### Estimate Iteration

- Babylonian Method
- Goldschmidt Equations
- Halley's Method
- Newton's Method
